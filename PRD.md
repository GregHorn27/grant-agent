### üèóÔ∏è MVP ARCHITECTURE DECISION: Lightweight Profiles + Rich Learning System
**Strategic Decision**: Keep Notion organization profiles lightweight, focus on building rich learning system for grant discovery feedback.

**Approach**:
- **Core Profile**: Essential organizational identity in Notion (legal structure, focus areas, location, team, budget)
- **Grant Discovery**: Cast wide net, learn from user feedback ("This grant won't work because...")
- **Application Learning**: Store detailed answers, build reusable knowledge base over time

### Phase 2: Organization Learning Engine  
**Goal**: Startup profile detection and multi-organization management

### Phase 3: Intelligent Grant Discovery (4 hours)
**Goal**: Web-wide grant search with smart relevance ranking

**Search Architecture**:
- Firecrawl integration for real-time web scraping
- Cast widest possible net across all web content
- Target search domains: grants.gov, foundation websites, government portals, nonprofit databases, Indigenous-focused funders
- Indigenous Wisdom focus areas: Cultural preservation, traditional knowledge systems, Indigenous education, land stewardship, ceremony and spiritual practices, intergenerational knowledge transfer, community healing, traditional ecological knowledge, language revitalization, Indigenous arts and crafts, traditional foodways, sacred site protection
- Extract: grant name, funder, amount, deadline, requirements, description

**Relevance Scoring Algorithm**:
```
Relevance Score (0-100) = Weighted average of:
- Mission alignment (40%): How well grant purpose matches org mission
- Focus area match (30%): Overlap in program areas/populations served
- Geographic eligibility (20%): Location requirements compatibility
- Organization size/type fit (10%): Budget level and legal structure match
```

**Results Presentation**:
```
Agent: "I found 47 potential grants. Here are my top 5 recommendations:

ü•á **Indigenous Knowledge Preservation Grant** (Relevance: 94/100)
   ‚Ä¢ Amount: $75,000
   ‚Ä¢ Deadline: March 15, 2024 (45 days remaining)

```

**Continuous Voice Refinement**:
- User feedback on generated responses: "This sounds too corporate" or "Perfect, that's exactly our voice"
- Learn from approved vs. rejected language choices
- Refine voice profile based on successful grant applications
- Adapt voice for different funders while maintaining authenticity

**Example Voice Learning**:
```
User uploads document with phrases like: "honoring ancient wisdom," "community-centered approach," "traditional knowledge keepers"
‚Üí Voice Profile learns: Use reverent language for traditional practices, emphasize community over individual, respect for elders/knowledge keepers

User feedback: "This response sounds too academic - we're more heart-centered in our communication"
‚Üí Voice Profile updates: Reduce academic language, increase emotional resonance and heart-centered terminology
```

### Phase 5: Conversational Learning System (3 hours)
**Goal**: Learn from user feedback to improve future recommendations

‚Üí Agent learns: "Exclude grants that don't accept fiscal sponsorship arrangements"

User: "Don't show me grants under $10,000"
‚Üí Agent learns: "Minimum grant amount filter: $10,000"

User: "I prefer education grants over environmental ones"
‚Üí Agent learns: "Weight education grants 2x in relevance scoring"
```

**Memory Architecture** (MVP):
```json
{
  "organization_profile": {
