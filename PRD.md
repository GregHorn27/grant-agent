        ‚Ä¢ How do grants differ between Coherence Lab vs KaiƒÅulu applications?
        ‚Ä¢ What specific land projects need funding?"

User: "Yes, and KaiƒÅulu focuses more on place-based ceremony"
Agent: "Perfect! I'll update the profile and save it to your database."
```

### üèóÔ∏è MVP ARCHITECTURE: Lightweight Profiles + Rich Learning System
**Strategic Decision**: Keep organization profiles focused on core identity, build rich learning through grant discovery feedback.

**Approach**:
- **Core Profile**: Essential organizational identity (legal structure, focus areas, location, team, budget)
- **Grant Discovery**: Cast wide net, learn from user feedback ("This grant won't work because...")
- **Application Learning**: Store detailed answers, build reusable knowledge base over time

**Status**: Moved to post-MVP roadmap - current focus is single organization (Coherence Lab)

### Phase 3: Intelligent Grant Discovery (TODAY'S PRIORITY - 4-5 hours)
**Goal**: Web-wide grant search with smart relevance ranking

**IMPLEMENTATION TODAY (Monday 7/28/25):**

**Search Architecture**:
- Firecrawl integration for real-time web scraping
- Target domains: grants.gov, foundation websites, government portals, nonprofit databases
- Extract: grant name, funder, amount, deadline, requirements, description
- Focus areas: Cultural preservation, traditional knowledge, Indigenous education, land stewardship, community healing

**Relevance Scoring Algorithm**:
```
Relevance Score (0-100) = Weighted average of:
- Mission alignment (40%): How well grant purpose matches org mission
- Focus area match (30%): Overlap in program areas/populations served
- Geographic eligibility (20%): Location requirements compatibility
- Organization size/type fit (10%): Budget level and legal structure match
```

**Results Presentation**:
```
Agent: "I found 47 potential grants. Here are my top 5 recommendations:

ü•á **Indigenous Knowledge Preservation Grant** (Relevance: 94/100)
   ‚Ä¢ Amount: $75,000
   ‚Ä¢ Deadline: March 15, 2024 (45 days remaining)
   ‚Ä¢ Perfect match: Hawaii location + Indigenous wisdom focus
   ‚Ä¢ Requirements: 501(c)(3) status or fiscal sponsor, 2+ years operation

ü•à **Community Healing & Wellness Initiative** (Relevance: 87/100)
   ‚Ä¢ Amount: $50,000
   ‚Ä¢ Deadline: February 28, 2024 (30 days remaining)
   ‚Ä¢ Great fit: Group coherence + community healing programs
   ‚Ä¢ Requirements: Focus on underserved communities, cultural practices

[Continue for top 5...]

Would you like me to add these to your grant tracking database in Notion?"
```

**SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - Single Notion Document:**
- Create dedicated Grant Feedback Notion page/database
- Track user feedback about grant recommendations
- Agent reads this document before each grant search for context
- User can add feedback through conversation

**Example Feedback to Track:**
- "Don't show grants under $25,000" ‚Üí Minimum amount preference
- "We can't work with funders that don't accept fiscal sponsorship" ‚Üí Eligibility filter
- "Focus more on Indigenous-specific funders" ‚Üí Relevance weighting
- "Avoid grants with complex reporting requirements" ‚Üí Complexity filter

**Usage**: Agent consults this document before each grant search to apply learned preferences
